This CPAN distribution file is designed for testing purposes only.
It has no usefulness in itself.

The test script that works with this file is t/31sessions.t in the
CPAN.pm distribution.

The test tries to determine if CPAN.pm could deal with the
optional_features in a distroprefs file correctly.
